## Projects
     I have some projects that are not uploaded and in private. But here are some notable ones. Thesis/Capstone and Commission Projects are not included here.
    
  -  <a href="https://github.com/75marsel/ProjectSayaka">**Project SAYAKA:**</a>
     Project Sayaka is a turn-based game using Python and PyQt5 GUI Framework. It has a database for accounts using SQLiteDict. This games requires walking of character and encountering
     enemies and defeating them by answering randomized basic math calculations. The project uploaded here does not include images for copyright purposes.
    
  - <a href="https://github.com/75marsel/hangmangame">**The Hangman Game:**</a>
     A Hangman game based on the same title Hangman. Where the player will start guessing the word by selecting appropriate letters to complete the puzzle. One mistake equals one step closer
     to loosing the game. This was developed using Python and PyGame framework. It has a database only in text file format (.txt) and will be improved at future.

  - <a href="https://github.com/75marsel/ArduinoOpenCV_LED">**Sample Face Detection with OpenCV and Arduino (PyFrimata):**</a>
     My freshmen face detection project using OpenCV and Python combined with Arduino's Firmata and Python's PyFirmata. Tested to turn on an LED if face is detecteed. This was also tested on
     solenoid door lock.

  - <a href="https://github.com/75marsel/InventoryManagementSystem">**Inventory Mangement System with User Authentication using DJango Full Stack:**</a>
     A practice app for implementing most features for Django including the most basic to the crucial functionalities needed for a working web app. The finished product is expected to be an
    RMA-focused Inventory Management Web application. Currently has CRUD, User Auth and will received iterative updates.

  - **RMA Serial Search using Python, PyQt5 and Pandas**</a>
     Made to streamline the process of data searching, warranty computation and queries of millions of RMA related data. A gift for my Internship to make the process of RMA on technical department
     fast. Developed using Python, PyQt5 GUI Framework and Pandas and with CSV Library for data handling and manipulation (for warranty computation),
    
  - **File Sorter:**
    Harvard's CSO50P Final Project Requirement. A File sorter script written in Python. This will automatically moves files into file category specific named folders depending on the user settings applied. To keep the settings saved,
    it uses SQLiteDict for storing the settings locally and MongoDB Atlas (PyMongo) for saving the settings to cloud for tinkering purposes! 
    
  -  <a href="https://github.com/75marsel/ArduinoLocationTracker">**Device Tracker with SMS Functionality and Short Range alarm:**</a>
    An Embedded system developed using Arduino, SIM800L, GPS NEO6Mv2, nrf24l01 and buzzer module. This will locate the device and stores in the arduino. The user can then send text messages
    to allow the tracker to send the coordinates back to the sender. It also has short range tracking using IR remote and RF communication. It will beep at second interval for locating
    the whereabouts of the device.

  - **Sumo Bot and Line Follower Robot:**
     A Robot that is capable of pushing and moving using sensor detections that pushes the enemy outside the ring (Sumo Bot) and A Robot that is capable of moving on its own along side the
     line tracks without the assistance of a human on controls.

## What I am currently Interested and Working on?

I am currently relearning Django Web Framework, Data analysis and Java Spring Boot. 

I also accept commissions on Computer Engineering related projects i.e. Robotics, Python, Java App, Thesis prototype etc.. 

Currently looking for an Entry Level job for fresh graduates that is related to Python or C so that I would be exposed to Industry standards! Preferabbly related to C or Python (much preferred hehe).

I am more inclined towards Software side but can also do Hardware stuffs like Robotics as I love A.I and I'm slowly working my progress on learning the things for it!

I would be glad be friending or collabing! Collaboration is also a way on expanding ones knowledge!
